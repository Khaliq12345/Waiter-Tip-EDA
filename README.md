# Explanatory Data Analysis of Waiter tips. 
Tipping waiters for serving food depends on many factors like the type of restaurant, how many people you are with, how much amount you pay as your bill, etc. Waiter Tips analysis is one of the popular data science case studies where we analyse the tips given to a waiter for serving the food in a restaurant. So if you want to learn how to solve this case study, then you are in the right place. In this project, I will take you through the task of waiter tips analysis with Python.

The food server of a restaurant recorded data about the tips given to the waiters for serving the food. The data recorded by the food server is as follows:

total_bill: Total bill in dollars including taxes

tip: Tip given to waiters in dollars

sex: gender of the person paying the bill

smoker: whether the person smoked or not

day: day of the week

time: lunch or dinner

size: number of people in a table 

So this is the data recorded by the restaurant. Based on this data, our task is to find the factors affecting waiter tips.
